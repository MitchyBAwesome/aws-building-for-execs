- The benefits of serverless vs infrastructure in a data center. No infrastructure management, no patching, etc.

- The cost benefit. Pay only when code is being executed. With the free tier, this code execution is free!

- The reliability and scalability. Code will execute in any AZ and can execute concurrently. No bottlenecks.

- You choose your programming language

- Code can be invoked by any event. Files landing in storage, alexa skill, the completion of other business logic, etc.
