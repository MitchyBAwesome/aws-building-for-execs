Amazon have commercialized drone delivery, and white labeled the service to be used by e-commerce platforms. Your senior leadership team at Octank are looking to be first to market to leverage this capability, and have asked you, as their development A-team to drop everything you're working on, and develop a minimum viable product (MVP) ready for testing by the end of the day to be the first to go to market.

The platform to be built will be a customer rewards system that will be available to our most loyal customers. These customers will have access to a voice enabled platform, where they can request a "surprise". Using machine learning, we will use the customer’s purchase history to determine which of 8 of our most popular products they would like the most, and deliver it to them via drone, then collect feedback from them via SMS.

The platform must meet the following business requirements:

- Leverage existing data on customers, products and purchase history to figure out customer preferences using machine learning.
- Interface with customers via a voice interface to identify them and determine a product that would most interest them, in real-time
- Have the user’s details and selected product delivered via an IoT message to the drone platform that will deliver the product
- Collect feedback from the user immediately after the delivery to ensure they are happy with their experience

The Octank architecture team have decided to leverage the AWS platform to reduce a lot of the heavy lifting and reinventing the wheel that's often involved with on-premises solutions. A member from the architecture team will be sitting with you to help guide you through the architecture proposed.

**Let’s get to work!**
